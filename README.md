# Laszlo's D Lang. Notes

My D Lang. notes are available here: https://arato.inf.unideb.hu/szathmary.laszlo/pmwiki/index.php?n=Acad.DLang . (The notes are in English.)

This repo. is an **issue tracker** for my notes. If you find any error,
or if you have some ideas how to improve these notes, let me know.

My notes are mainly based on the book [Programming in D](https://ddili.org/ders/d.en/), written by Ali Ã‡ehreli. This book
is freely available. As I progess in this book, I update
my notes. Currently, I'm at about 40% of the book.

## Target Audience

These notes function as cheat sheets for me, but anyone can use them
who is learning D. At several places, I also provide Python
solutions next to the D version. So these notes can be
especially useful for Python programmers who want to learn D.
